pre req -> traversal
how bst is different from bs ?
in bst left node should be lessser than the right node and right node should 
be lesser than the node's value 
i.e : L < N < R
Also entire left subtree should be a bst and same goes for right subtree 


are duplicates allowed -> Ideally duplicaets are not allowed 
but in some books it says duplicaets are allowed 
If duplicaets are allowed then the comditio for bst is 
L <= N <= R 

Why BST ?
In binary search tree all the height of the tree is (logN)
but in binary trees the height is O(n)

Search in Binary tree is O(N)
but search in binary search trees is O(logn)
because we implement binary search in binary search(kind of binary search)
